The following questions central to Mandarin syllables remain controversial and are studied: (a) What are the general phonotactic principles – both local and long-distance ones – that Mandarin syllables abide by? (b) What grammar can best account for native speakers phonotactic intuition on what represents a well-formed syllable in Mandarin? (c) What is the status of the pre-vocalic glide [j] within the syllable: is it segmental (Cj) or, else, is it palatalized, i.e., realized as a secondary articulation (Cj)? This thesis seeks to contribute to the scientific understanding of the questions listed in (a-c), by implementing a series of experimental and computational methodologies to investigate syllables in Mandarin Chinese.

<li><b>Attachment and Prosody of English and Mandarin Relative Clauses.</b></li> 
<p  style="text-align:justify">
This paper addresses whether and how prosodic cues and attachment bias correlate. A survey including both Chinese relative clauses and English relative clauses is carrie out to examine: (a) the attachment bias of Chinese relative clauses from Chinese speakers; (b) the influence on attachment judgment from their native language Chinese to their second language English. Furthermore, the data from the experiment were analysed to illustrate the correlation between prosodic cues (stress and pause) and RC attachment.

<p  style="text-align:justify">
The Tolerance Principle is used to describe patterns of morphological rule generalizations based on the number of exceptions to that rule. Some problematic cases
exist, such as that of Arabic broken plurals, where the 'default' case is not the most
popular in the data. To get a better understanding of Arabic's place in this theory, we
examine several corpora of Modern Standard Arabic. We looked at the *n* most frequent
nominal forms (for several values of *n*, 100 to 1000) and looked at the rate of regular to
broken plurals. Additionally, we used the inflectional classes (describing what suffixes a
root could take) to determine what patterns were reliable predictors of 'brokenness'. Thus,
we find that broken plurals are limited to certain inflectional classes, and thus are
restricted by features of those classes. Next steps are to link the two halves of this project
for more decisive results, then expand this work to spoken dialects of Arabic.

<li><b>Performance of Position Models on Mandarin syllables</b></li>
<p  style="text-align:justify">
The position models include two major types: Position based on string index and position based on syllable positions (onset, nucleus, coda). Mandarin phonotactic patterns are learned and examined by the Position Models. The four position models can process both the distant restrictions and the local ones with 90% - 100% accuracy. The performances of different position models are similar. This is possibly due to the short length of Mandarin syllables (length not bigger than 4). Thus, the index position labels (at most 4 indexes) are similar to syllable position labels (at most 4 indexes).
